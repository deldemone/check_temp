check_temp

A small Nagios plugin that checks the CPU (or M/B) temperature with lm-sensors.
It's written in Bash and uses some sed & awk.
Default is to check the CPU temperature but this can be changed to for example 
the motherboard temperature with a "--sensor" argument. 
The plugin complies with the guidelines, for example uses -w -c -v arguments 
etc. It also does some basic sanity checks and has a exit 3 catchall.

The plugin were submitted to Nagios Exchange in 2011.
