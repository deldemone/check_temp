Version 0.2: 
   Line 103, fixed the missing "-n" option (Thanks to Chad who pointed this out
   this out for me). Also added a "shopt -s extglob". (Thx to Chad)

Version 0.5: 
   Line 168, fixed a typo (EXIT_UNKNOWN to STATE_UNKNOWN)

Version 0.7:
   Line 193, modified sensor parsing to cut after the first '+' since all
     positive temperatures are preceded by a '+'
   Line 211, reduced "verbosity" needed to see verbose info (was 2: -v -v)
   Line 229-232, now checks to see if no sensor data was found and
     exits with STATE_UNKNOWN

Version 0.8:
   Line 196 and 230, added 'head -n1' to only fetch the first result from
     sensors output. On some machine you get two Core0 and two Core1 temps.
   Moved version history to it's own file, HISTORY

Version 0.94:
    Lots of changes and bugfixes. A huge thank you to Ryan Loudfoot who
    has fixed bugs and worked out a new way to detect the sensors-program.
    In 0.94 I removed /etc from the whereis path as it didn't work for me
    on my setup. It found the config-file for lm-sensors and tried to run
    it.

Version 0.95:
    Changed the Performance Data Field to only contain a label and the
    actual value in celsius. For example "temperature=39".
